How to read this report:
- Table rows correspond to security regimes
- Table columns correspond to proof system components
- Cells show bits of security per component
- Proof size estimates are indicative (1 KiB = 1024 bytes)

**Parameters:**

- PCS: FRI
- Hash size (bits): 256
- Number of queries: 87
- Grinding query phase (bits): 28
- Grinding commit phase, at every folding round (bits): 5
- Field: M31⁴
- Rate (ρ): 0.5
- Trace length (H): $2^{24}$
- FRI rounds: 5
- FRI folding factors: [16, 16, 16, 8, 8]
- FRI early stop degree: 128
- Batch size: 1225
- Batching: Powers
- Grinding DEEP (bits): 12
- Number of constraints: 928
- Lookup (logup): generic_lookup
- Lookup (logup): range_check_16_lookup
- Lookup (logup): range_check_19_lookup
- Lookup (logup): decoder

**Proof Size:** 1836 KiB (expected) / 1951 KiB (worst case)
