# 📊 OpenVM (v1.5.0)

How to read this report:
- Table rows correspond to security regimes
- Table columns correspond to proof system components
- Cells show bits of security per component
- Proof size estimates are indicative (1 KiB = 1024 bytes)

## zkVM Overview

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Final bits of security | **100 bits** | [app](#app) | Regime: UDR |
| Final proof size (worst case) | **8231 KiB** | [internal](#internal) | |
